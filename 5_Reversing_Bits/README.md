# Reversing Bits

Reverse the bits of an input value's binary representation.
Input and Output Signals

    din - Input value
    dout - Bitwise reversed value

## Example : 

In the first input value, the reversed binary representation of xd is xb because b1101 is reversed to b1011.

In the second input value, if we assume DATA_WIDTH = 4 then the reversed binary representation of x4 is x2 because b0100 is reversed to b0010. Notice how DATA_WIDTH determines how many trailing and leading 0's there are in the reversed result.
